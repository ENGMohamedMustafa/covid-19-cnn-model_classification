decribtion:
The datasets used to create the CL-COVIDset are publicly available.
  The CT images in the CL-COVIDset consist of normal scans [43] and scans showing infections caused by the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain [43] and its Omicron and Delta variants [44]. 
  The dataset also included CT images of other viral pneumonia infections [43]
  . X-ray images in the CL-COVIDset also included normal scans and those showing infections caused by MERS [45], SARS [45], wild-type SARS-CoV-2 [45], the Omicron and Delta variants [44], 
other vi-ral pneumonia infections [46,47], and bacterial pneumonia [48] infections.
The CL-COVIDset consisted of three sets: a training set, a validation set, and an eval-uation set (see Table 1). 
  The use of the validation set allowed us to fine-tune our model, and the model was finally tested for performance on the evaluation set. 
    The performance of the model on the evaluation set was assessed using observed and unobserved data and distributions.
    To facilitate the use of CL-COVIDset by the wider research community
